# COMP250 - Personality Based AI Decision Making for NPCs in Video Games and Emergent Gameplay Mechanics

## Introduction
This project is a modular, generative AI system that allows designers to generate AI NPCs with
random or preset personalities that will carry out their given tasks based on their predispositions
according to their personality types.

## Project Outline

This artefact allows designers to:
1. Create their own preset personality types that will generate AI behaviour based on
their parameters while still maintaining a degree of randomness. 
2. Randomly generate AI behaviour and leave the action weightings entirely up to the algorithm.

## Software Architecture

This project is based largely off a technique called Dynamic Scripting, which is is primarily used as a form of reinforcement learning to teach AI to achieve
certain goals. This artefact has modified it to instead focus on emulating the flaws of human personalities and errors in judgment.

The AI is randomly generated by default. It has the options to move, drink, eat, watch tv, use the toilet, sleep, or work.
On play, the AI will be generated using random weightings to determine what it is predisposed to value over other tasks. This can also be modified using the PersonalityPreset script.

## Instructions

To run the software, open the program in Unity. By default, when you press play, a random AI will be generated.
To generate an AI preset, attach the PersonalityPreset script to the NPC in the game scene. Then, in the editor, adjust the weightings as desired.
Keep in mind that the weightings are in a range between 0.1 and 1. Anything less than or above those values will be automatically adjusted accordingly.
The Debug Log will provide more context for what is happening in the scene. The sphere represents a toilet, the cube a sink, the upright rectangle a fridge, the panel a TV. The bed and computer are relatively self-explanatory.
