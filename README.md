# COMP250 Proposal: Nightmare Labyrinth

## Introduction
Nightmare Labyrinth is a procedurally generated labyrinth which players have to navigate while avoiding enemies and traps along the way. This project would focus on using a heartbeat sensor to detect when variable conditions and combinations result in an increased heartrate. Based on these findings, the AI controller could then alter the generation of the maze and enemy spawning to continuosly scare the player. My chosen specialism is artificial intelligence in games programming. This project is alignment with that specialization because the AI will be in control of procedurally spawning a labyrinth and the enemies within. This artefact is needed to prove that AI-controlled horror games can procedurally generate terror.

## Project Scope

This project will use two different types of pattern recognition methods in all possible combinations with two different approaches to generating fear responses. The demo itself will consist of a proceduraly generated maze, and 3 types of AI controlled enemies: spiders, clowns, and demons. The player will be hooked up to a finger-strap style pulse monitor which will let the AI determine the player's current fear state.

## Similar Projects

There are a number of horror games that utilize proceduraly generated maps and enemy spawning. This artefact will differ from the Vanish experiments in a number of ways. In the Vanish experiments, the physiological input modified how the AI controller spawned in preset events, rooms, monster AI, etc. In this artefact, the physiological input will modify the AI controller based soley off pattern recognition alone. Instead of a number of preset scripted events, the AI will experiment and catalog different ways of scaring users, theoretically becoming more effective at eliciting more intense fear responses over time.
