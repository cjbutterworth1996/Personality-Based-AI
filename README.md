# COMP250 Proposal: Nightmare Labyrinth

## Introduction
Nightmare Labyrinth is a procedurally generated labyrinth which players have to navigate while avoiding enemies and traps along the way. This project would focus on using a heartbeat sensor to detect when variable conditions and combinations result in an increased heartrate. Based on these findings, the AI controller could then alter the generation of the maze and enemy spawning to continuosly scare the player. My chosen specialism is artificial intelligence in games programming. This project is in alignment with that specialization because the AI will be in control of procedurally spawning a labyrinth and the enemies within. This artefact is needed to prove that AI-controlled horror games can procedurally generate terror.

## Project Scope

This project will use two different types of pattern recognition methods in all possible combinations with two different approaches to generating fear responses. The demo itself will consist of a procedurally generated maze, and 3 types of AI controlled enemies: spiders, clowns, and demons. The player will be hooked up to a finger-strap style pulse monitor which will let the AI determine the player's current fear state.

## Similar Projects

There are a number of horror games that utilize procedurally generated maps and enemy spawning. The most similar to this project's aim and scope is Vanish. According to the game's listing on gamejolt.com, Vanish is "dynamically generated at run-time and continues to change while the player plays it. Each hall piece dynamically spawns with certain objects and events that dynamically spawn as well, which creates an ever changing game that no two players will ever experience exactly the same." In an article published in 2015, the game developers for Vanish ran a study for the game that attempted to determine if "biofeedback-enabled adaptive methods have a significant impact on any specific aspect of the players' gameplay experience." The study had two biofeedback-enabled inputs that adapted the player experience: arousal and valence. Arousal was determined through an increase/decrease in skin conductivity and heart rate, while valence was determined via facial EMG (electromyography) at the cheek and brow muscles. The development team then used this data to affect the gaming experience in various different ways. This artefact is much more limited in scope than the Vanish team's study, so only the relevant gaming experience alterations will be detailed here. In one of these alterations "the player's arousal level was inversely correlated with the probability of generating a creature encounter."

This artefact will differ from the Vanish experiments in a number of ways. In the Vanish experiments, the physiological input modified how the AI controller spawned in preset events, rooms, monster AI, etc. In this artefact, the physiological input will modify the AI controller based soley off pattern recognition alone. Instead of a number of preset scripted events, the AI will experiment and catalog different ways of scaring users, theoretically becoming more effective at eliciting more intense fear responses over time.
