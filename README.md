# COMP250 - Personality Based AI Decision Making for NPCs in Video Games and Emergent Gameplay Mechanics

## Introduction
This project is a modular, generative AI system that allows designers to generate AI NPCs with
random or preset personalities that will carry out their given tasks based on their predispositions
according to their personality types.

## Project Outline

This artefact allows designers to:
1. Create their own preset personality types that will generate AI behaviour based on
their parameters while still maintaining a degree of randomness. 
2. Randomly generate AI behaviour and leave the action weightings entirely up to the algorithm.

## Software Architecture

This project is based largely off a technique called Dynamic Scripting, which is is primarily used as a form of reinforcement learning to teach AI to achieve
certain goals. This artefact has modified it to instead focus on emulating the flaws of human personalities and errors in judgment.
